    <string name="post_text">Spent some time this afternoon trying to make progress getting @cryptix\'s go sbot + #patchql going on #android \nI hit a small milestone just now:  with the server running on android publish a few contact messages and a few posts using the go ssb client on my computer got patchql to parse the go server offset file and I can see those messages in the sql db.\n (!!!)  \nThis is very cool and it also feels like there\'s a hell of a lot to do to get this usable.  \nI\'m dealing with a few bugs / crashes / etc, and I need to do a bunch of stuff manually to make this work.  \ncc @Luandro @mixmix @Maui @dino∆ßùî∏‚ìä·ñá</string>
